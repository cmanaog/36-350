cat("Hello aliens. My name is Christian Manaog. I have been selected on behalf
    of earth to be the spokeperson for this planet. There are a lot of things 
    that are imperfections on this planet. If you're hearing this, then at this
    very moment, millions of us are dying from starvation, disease, and war. 
    We are living on the edge of oblivion as we are only short misunderstandings
    away from completely destroying our planet. But the human race has a saving
    grace, a perfect God whose mercy has saved us from death. And if He has put
    life on other planets, then you too are a part of His great plan. So even
    though there is evil on this planet, know that you will be welcomed and 
    accepted like any other being on this planet. We'll be waiting.")
